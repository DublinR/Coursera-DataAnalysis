\section{Data Analysis with Jeff Leek}
Data analysis is the process of finding the right data to answer your question, understanding the processes underlying the data, discovering the important patterns in the data, and then communicating your results to have the biggest possible impact. 

This course will cover some of the most popular and widely used statistical methods like linear regression, principal components analysis, cross-validation, and p-values.
